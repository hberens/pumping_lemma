# pumping_lemma
This code takes in an infinite language in the form of a regex, checks if it is regular, and if so, displays a random pumpable string from the language. 


This project aims to explore the Pumping Lemma for regular languages and implement a function that checks whether a given inifinte language is pumpable. The Pumping Lemma provides a way of checking if any infinite string in a language is infinitely pumpable both upwards and downwards. It asserts that for any regular language, there exists a pumping length (p) for which any string s in the language with length >= p, you can split s into three substrings xyz where |y| >= 0 and |xy| <= p and xy^iz is also in the language for any integer i>=0. The goal of this project is to generate strings that satisfy the conditions of the Pumping Lemma and verify if they are "pumpable" by checking if their structure allows for repetition of certain substrings. 


When running the code, it will ask for a language. Input some sort of regex like a*b*c* which is pumpable or a{n}b{n} which is not pumpable. Then input the pumping length you want to test for that language. It will then run all the functions, and if there are pumpable strings (under a certain length as to help with readbility) in that language, it will randomly choose 1 and print it to the user. If none are found, the language is not regular, and this message is printed to the user. It chooses a random pumpable string as to provide variety for the user when they run the code on the same regex, as well as to provide them the opportunity to see a variety of types of strings that are pumpable so they can see patterns. 

I chose this project because I did not successfully use the Pumping Lemma on the second exam, so I felt it was a deficiency. I also think that the conditions can be confusing as to why they exist, so generating my own strings in Python was helpful in deepedning my understanding on why those conditions exist and how they relate to infinite strings. Additionally, since the Pumping Lemma is very powerful and important since we talked about regular languages for a long time in class, I thought that this was a more important deficiency to work on. 
I learned how to apply the Pumping Lemma to check if a language generated by a regular expression can be pumped. This involves generating candidate strings, splitting them into parts (u, v, x, y, z), and checking if repeating the v and y parts results in valid strings in the language. This program also helped deepen my understanding od regular expressions which I would also consider a deficiency. This project helped me understand how regular expressions can be used to describe languages and how to generate strings that match a given regular expression. I learned how to generate strings based on regular expressions and analyze whether these strings can satisfy the conditions of the Pumping Lemma.
Lastly, this project was helpful in practicing using the regex libaries in Python that I do not usually use as well as the random libary and wroking with string manipulation.
